"2","After successful login, refreshing a duplicated /login tab does not redirect the authorized user to /dashboard.","","Vladyslav Mazur","Unassigned","**Preconditions:**

* User exists in the database (e.g., `user@example.com`).

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open `/login` page in a browser.
2. Duplicate the login tab (Ctrl + T → right-click → “Duplicate”).
3. In the **first tab**, enter valid credentials and click **Login**.
    → User successfully logs in and is redirected to `/dashboard`.
4. Switch to the **duplicated** `/login` tab.
5. Refresh the duplicated `/login` page.

**Expected Result:**

* Since the user already has a valid session (cookie set), the app should automatically redirect to `/dashboard`.
* Login page should not be accessible for authorized users.

**Actual Result:**

* The duplicated `/login` page remains visible even after refresh.
* Only after manually navigating to `/dashboard`, user is redirected correctly.","Resolved","","Minor","","",""
